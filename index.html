	The 2014 University of Georgia season was all in all a fairly successful season.
        The head coach during that season was Mark Richt.
        The Bulldogs had 10 wins and 3 losses. In conference play the Bulldogs went 6-2,
        with their only losses coming to South Carolina and Florida. Georgia finished the
        season ranked 9th in country and looked forward to a promising year in 2015. The fianl
		game of the season was to be a game against Lousiville in the Belk Bowl. The Bulldogs
		put up a very good game against the Louisville Cardinals and won the Belk Bowl by 23 points.
		The final score was University of Georgia 37 and Louisville 14.

        The 2015 season for the University of Georgia Bulldogs was very similar to their season in 2014. The Bulldogs were again led by coach Mark Richt and
        went 10-3. The Season included three losses. Those losses came against Alabama, Tennessee, and Florida. Unfortunately at the end of the season Georgia was not ranked in the top 25
        The Season was overall good, but was disappointing in the fact that they missed out on the SEC Championship. However, UGA did find itself in the Tax Slayer Bowl, in which
		they played the Penn State Nittany Lions. This was a close battle, but the dawgs came out on top. The final score was UGA 24 and Penn State 17.

        The 2016 season was comparatively worse for the Georgia Bulldogs. The Bulldogs had 8 wins and 5 loses. This season was also very different from the rest,
        because Georgia had a new head coach. Coach Kirby Smart left Alabama and became the head coach at UGA. This season was a starting point for the Georgia Bulldogs
        to build an identity, while the players developed. Although, the win to loss ration in this season was disappointing, it would lead to a bright 2017 season. The season 
		was defined by losses to Ole Miss, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Florida, and Georgia Tech. However, the Bulldogs managed to salvage the season in their bowl game. The bowl game
		that the dawgs played in was called the Liberty Bowl and they played against the TCU Horned Frogs. This game was a bright side to a bad 2016 season because the dawgs came out
		on top with a score of 31 to 23.
